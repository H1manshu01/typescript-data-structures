# TypeScript Data Structures
==========================

A collection of data structures implemented in TypeScript.

## Introduction
---------------

This project provides a set of commonly used data structures implemented in TypeScript. The goal is to provide a robust and efficient implementation of these data structures, making it easy for developers to use them in their projects.

## Features
------------

*   **Linked List**: A doubly linked list implementation with methods for inserting, deleting, and traversing nodes.
*   **Queue**: A queue implementation with methods for enqueueing, dequeueing, and peeking at elements.
*   **Stack**: A stack implementation with methods for pushing, popping, and peeking at elements.
*   **Other Data Structures**: More data structures will be added in the future, including trees, graphs, and more.

## Installation
---------------

To install the TypeScript Data Structures library, run the following command:

```bash
npm install ost-typescript-data-structures
```

## Usage
```bash
import { LinkedList } from 'ost-typescript-data-structures';

const list = new LinkedList<number>();

list.append(1);
list.append(2);
list.append(3);

console.log(list.toArray()); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
